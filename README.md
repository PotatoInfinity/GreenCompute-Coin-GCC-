# ❇️ GreenCompute Coin (GCC)  
*The future of Decentralized, Eco-friendly Compute and Hosting*  

---

## Core Philosophy  
GCC is a fair-launch, deflationary cryptocurrency designed to power distributed computing, AI, and storage tasks. This allows users to run services or applications with high reliability and performance without relying on centralized data centers.  

- **Fair play:** Everyone starts equally, no pre-mine. GCC is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls GCC. GCC is controlled by all GCC users around the world. Developers can improve the software, but they can't change the rules of the GCC protocol.  
- **Secure:** Everything is encrypted and verified by all nodes planet-wide.  
- **Reliable:** Tasks are distributed to billions of individual nodes, ensuring no single point of failure.  
- **Deflationary economy & Increasing scarcity:** Fixed supply cap of 1,000,000,000 GCC; with a dynamic burn and small developer treasury fee on every transaction.

## Problem  
Centralized data centers are heating up the planet. Concentrated servers consume massive amounts of electricity, require industrial cooling, and create an unsustainable environmental footprint. Cooling systems alone can account for 50% of a data center’s total energy consumption.  

Meanwhile, billions of personal computers, laptops, and even phones sit idle, wasting potential computing power. While hyperscale data centers feel dominant, they actually account for less than 1% of **the world’s total potential computing power across all personal and IoT devices**. The other 99% is scattered across billions of devices—yet most of that potential remains untouched. Instead of contributing to meaningful workloads, these machines spend their cycles on light tasks like browsing, video streaming, or sitting idle. GCC aims to unlock this vast, wasted capacity, transforming everyday devices into part of a global, eco-friendly computing network.  

**_💡 Did you know?  
A single Phone chip delivers around 1–2 TFLOPS of compute power. Multiply that by the 6.8 billion smartphones in use today, and you get an astonishing 6,800–13,600 exaflops. For comparison, the entire TOP500 supercomputers combined deliver only ~2,000–3,000 exaflops._**

## Vision  
GreenCompute Coin (GCC) solves this problem: Instead of relying on massive, concentrated data centers, billions of small, distributed machines (PCs, laptops, IoT devices) work together to form a **planet-scale, green supercomputer network.**  

Each device contributes a little bandwidth, compute, and storage.  

---

## How it Works  

- **Mining by contribution:** Users mine GCC not by wasteful hashing, but by contributing real compute/storage/bandwidth to the network. Contributors earn GCC only when they complete verified tasks. Earnings are proportional to the amount of verified work they perform.  
- **Unified planetary supercomputer:** Users do not select individual nodes. All devices combine into a single global network. When a workload is submitted, the protocol automatically shards it and distributes tasks to appropriate nodes.  
- **Use cases:** AI training/inference, 3D rendering, file hosting, or website serving through a decentralized, encrypted IPFS-style network.  
- **Pay with GCC → Get resources:** Buy GCC coins to access secure and reliable computing power. The network automatically executes workloads across many contributors, then returns the result.  
- **Eco advantage:** Small, distributed machines generate less heat and require no industrial cooling system. Compute is closer to consumers, reducing data transfer pollution.  
- **Stable compute-per-dollar:** Each GCC represents the amount of verified contribution required to mine it. As scarcity increases and price rises, compute value per GCC scales so that $10 worth of GCC always buys roughly the same amount of computation over time.

## Tokenomics  

- **Total supply cap:** 1 billion GCC  
- **Block time:** 10 minutes  
- **Reward per block:** Dynamic, based on verified contributions  
  - Formula: `Block Reward = min(TotalContribution × RewardPerUnit, MaxBlockReward)`  
    - `TotalContribution`: verified compute/storage/bandwidth in the block  
    - `RewardPerUnit`: GCC per unit of work  
    - Unit = `CPU GFLOPs×1 + GPU GFLOPs×5 + Storage GB-day×0.1 + Bandwidth GB×0.2`  
    - Reward (GCC) = `Units×0.01 GCC/unit`  
    - `MaxBlockReward`: 200 GCC/block max to prevent extreme spikes  

### Fee & Burn Policy 
To balance scarcity, usability, and ongoing development, GCC introduces a **triple-split fee system**:  

- **93% → Contributors** (community providers of compute/storage/bandwidth)  
- **5% → Burn** (applied to all payments, permanently reducing supply)  
- **2% → Developer Treasury** (sustainable funding for protocol development and ecosystem growth)  

Additionally, GCC applies **transaction-type burns**:  
- **5% burn** → Compute/storage/hosting payments (utility transactions).  
- **10% burn** → Peer-to-peer transfers and trading (speculative transactions).  

This ensures:  
- Utility remains affordable and encourages real network usage.  
- Scarcity increases rapidly from trading, fueling long-term value growth.  
- Developer funding remains modest, fair, and tied to actual usage.  

- **Halving cycle:** Every 4 years (reduces RewardPerUnit by 50%).  

**Flow:**  
`Users buy GCC → Spend for compute/storage → Contributors execute → Verified contribution tallied → Contributors earn GCC (93%) → 5–10% burned → 2% to dev treasury → Scarcity increases + ecosystem sustained`  

**Dynamic compute-per-GCC:** As scarcity increases and price rises, each GCC represents more verified contribution, maintaining compute-per-dollar stability for users.

## Scale vs Inefficiency  

Centralized data centers are efficient but represent less than **1% of the world’s total computing potential.**  

- **Global compute potential:** ~6,800–13,600 exaflops (from smartphones alone).  
- **TOP500 supercomputers combined:** ~2,000–3,000 exaflops.  
- Even if GCC is **3× less efficient** (due to sandboxing, redundancy, and verification), it still unlocks **>33× the power** of today’s entire supercomputer fleet.  

**Efficiency doesn’t matter when scale dominates.**  
GCC brute-forces inefficiency through sheer planetary participation.

## Security and Redundancy  

- Every task is split and verified across multiple contributors.  
- Multiple nodes back up critical data to prevent loss.  
- No single point of failure.  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** Validators secure the chain by staking GCC, ensuring energy efficiency and Sybil resistance.  
- **Proof-of-Contribution (PoC):** Contributors provide compute/storage/bandwidth and prove their work cryptographically. Rewards are distributed proportionally.  
- **Proof-of-Uptime & Reputation System:** Nodes earn reputation by staying online and being accurate. Higher-rep nodes get more work and rewards.  

---

## Process  

GCC turns every participating machine into a piece of a **planet-wide supercomputer**, creating a fully decentralized, eco-friendly network for computing needs.  

- **Universal Contributions:** Any machine, big or small, can join. All hardware contributes CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth.  
- **Task sharding & distribution:** Workloads are automatically broken into shards. More powerful nodes get more shards. The scheduler ensures redundancy and geographic diversity to improve reliability and latency.  
- **Execution and verification:** Nodes execute tasks in sandboxed environments. Results are verified by multiple nodes (>50% agreement = valid).  
- **Storage:** Files and datasets are split, encrypted, and stored redundantly across independent nodes.  
- **Reliability scoring:** Uptime + accuracy build a reputation score. Higher scores = more tasks + more rewards.  
- **Payment & burn:** Users pay in GCC, fees are split (93% providers, 5% burn, 2% dev).
