# ‚ùáÔ∏è GreenCompute Coin (GCC)  
*The future of Decentralized, Eco-friendly Compute and Hosting*

## Core Philosophy  
GCC is a fair-launch, deflationary cryptocurrency designed to power distributed computing, AI, and storage tasks. This allows users to run services or applications with high reliability and performance **without relying on centralized data centers.**  

- **Fair play:** Everyone starts equally, no pre-mine. GCC is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls GCC. GCC is controlled by all GCC users around the world. Developers can improve the software, but they cannot change the rules of the GCC protocol.  
- **Secure:** Everything is encrypted and verified by all nodes planet-wide.  
- **Reliable through redundancy:** Tasks are distributed to billions of devices and executed redundantly to eliminate single points of failure.  
- **Deflationary economy & increasing scarcity:** Fixed supply cap of 1,000,000,000 GCC; with a 10% burn on every transaction.

## Problem  
Centralized data centers are heating up the planet. Concentrated servers consume massive amounts of electricity, require industrial cooling, and create an unsustainable environmental footprint. Cooling systems alone can account for 50% of a data center‚Äôs total energy consumption.  

Meanwhile, billions of personal computers, laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices sit idle, wasting potential computing power. Hyperscale data centers feel dominant, but they account for less than **1% of the world‚Äôs total potential computing power.** The other 99% is scattered across billions of devices, yet remains unused.  

Instead of contributing to meaningful workloads, these machines spend their cycles on light tasks or sit idle. GCC unlocks this vast, wasted capacity, transforming everyday devices into part of a global, eco-friendly computing network.  

**_üí° Did you know?_**  
*A single phone chip delivers ~1‚Äì2 TFLOPS of compute power. With 6.8 billion smartphones in use today, that equals **6,800‚Äì13,600 exaflops**. By comparison, the entire TOP500 supercomputers combined deliver only ~2,000‚Äì3,000 exaflops.*

## Vision  
GreenCompute Coin (GCC) solves this problem: Instead of relying on massive, concentrated data centers, billions of small, distributed machines (PCs, laptops, IoT devices) work together to form a **planet-scale, green supercomputer network.**  

Each device contributes a little bandwidth, compute, and storage. At scale, redundancy and brute force transform these idle resources into the world‚Äôs most powerful decentralized computing grid.

## How it Works  

- **Mining by Contribution (PoC):** Users earn GCC not by wasteful hashing, but by contributing real compute, storage, or bandwidth to the network. Rewards are proportional to verified contributions.  
- **Unified planetary supercomputer:** All devices combine into a single global network. Workloads are automatically sharded and distributed.  
- **Brute force reliability:** Each shard is executed by many devices simultaneously. Even if most drop offline, majority consensus ensures correctness.  
- **Sandboxed execution:** Tasks run inside secure sandboxes (e.g. WASM or lightweight VMs), isolating workloads from host devices. Security is prioritized over efficiency.  
- **Use cases:** AI training, 3D rendering, file hosting, website serving, scientific workloads, and more.  
- **Pay with GCC ‚Üí Get resources:** Buy GCC to access compute or storage. Contributors execute workloads, the network verifies results, and contributors are paid.  
- **Eco advantage:** Small, distributed machines produce less heat, require no industrial cooling, and reduce long-distance data transfer pollution.  
- **Stable compute-per-dollar:** Each GCC represents the verified contribution needed to mine it. As scarcity rises, compute value per GCC scales to preserve stable cost-to-compute for users.

## Tokenomics  

- **Total supply cap:** 1 billion GCC  
- **Block time:** 10 minutes  
- **Reward per block:** Dynamic, based on verified contributions  
  - Formula:  
    `Block Reward = min(TotalContribution √ó RewardPerUnit, MaxBlockReward)`  
    - `TotalContribution`: verified compute/storage/bandwidth in the block  
    - `RewardPerUnit`: GCC per unit of work  
    - Unit = `CPU GFLOPs√ó1 + GPU GFLOPs√ó5 + Storage GB-day√ó0.1 + Bandwidth GB√ó0.2`  
    - Reward = `Units √ó 0.01 GCC/unit`  
    - `MaxBlockReward = 200 GCC/block` (to prevent spikes)  
- **Burn policy:** 10% of all GCC spent is permanently destroyed.  
- **Halving cycle:** Every 4 years, RewardPerUnit is reduced by 50%.  

**Flow:**  
`Users buy GCC ‚Üí Spend for compute/storage ‚Üí Contributors execute ‚Üí Verified contributions tallied ‚Üí Contributors earn GCC ‚Üí 10% burned ‚Üí Scarcity increases`  

**Dynamic compute-per-GCC:** Scarcity ensures $10 worth of GCC always buys roughly the same compute over time.

## Consensus Mechanism: PoS + PoC  

GCC eliminates wasteful Proof of Work. Instead, it uses a hybrid **Proof of Stake (PoS) + Proof of Contribution (PoC)** consensus model.  

### Proof of Stake (PoS)  
- Validators are chosen based on stake to propose and validate blocks.  
- PoS ensures chain security and Sybil resistance with minimal energy usage.  

### Proof of Contribution (PoC)  
- Contributors earn rewards for verified compute, storage, and bandwidth.  
- Tasks are redundantly executed and verified by majority consensus.  
- Contribution history and reputation influence future task assignments.  

### Hybrid Flow  
1. Validators (PoS) secure the blockchain and confirm transactions.  
2. Contributors (PoC) provide computing/storage resources.  
3. Rewards are split:  
   - PoS validators earn a small percentage for security.  
   - PoC contributors earn the majority for real-world work.

## Security and Redundancy  

- **Redundant sharding:** Every task is executed by many nodes simultaneously. Results are accepted only if a majority (or weighted consensus) agree.  
- **Sandboxed workloads:** Tasks run in isolated environments, protecting user devices.  
- **Proof-of-Uptime & Reputation System:** Nodes gain reputation through accuracy and availability. Higher-rep nodes receive more tasks and rewards.  
- **Geographic diversity:** Shards are distributed globally to reduce latency and increase resilience.  
- **Encrypted storage:** Files are split, encrypted, and stored redundantly across independent nodes.  

Even if redundancy and sandboxing make the network 2‚Äì3√ó less efficient than hyperscale data centers, GCC still **outcompetes through brute-force scale** ‚Äî tapping into the 99% of global compute that sits idle.  

---

## Process  

1. **Universal Contributions:** Any device can join. All hardware contributes CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth.  
2. **Task Sharding:** Workloads are split and distributed to many devices. More powerful nodes receive larger shards.  
3. **Redundant Execution:** Each shard is run on multiple nodes simultaneously.  
4. **Verification:** Results are compared. Majority consensus validates correctness.  
5. **Storage:** Files/datasets are split, encrypted, and stored redundantly.  
6. **Payment & Burn:** Users pay in GCC. Contributors are rewarded. 10% is burned.
