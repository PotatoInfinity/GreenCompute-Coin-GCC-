# ❇️ GreenCompute Coin (GCC)

*The future of Decentralized, Eco-friendly Compute and Hosting*

---

## Core Philosophy

GCC is a fair-launch, deflationary cryptocurrency designed to power distributed computing, AI, and storage tasks. This allows users to run services or applications with high reliability and performance without relying on centralized data centers.

* **Fair play:** Everyone starts equally, no pre-mine. GCC is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls GCC. GCC is controlled by all GCC users around the world. Developers can improve the software, but they can't change the rules of the GCC protocol.
* **Secure:** Everything is encrypted and verified by all nodes planet-wide.
* **Reliable:** Tasks are distributed to billions of individual nodes, ensuring no single point of failure.
* **Deflationary economy & Increasing scarcity:** Fixed supply cap of 1,000,000,000 GCC; with a dynamic burn and small developer treasury fee on every transaction.

## Problem

Centralized data centers are heating up the planet. Concentrated servers consume massive amounts of electricity, require industrial cooling, and create an unsustainable environmental footprint. Cooling systems alone can account for 50% of a data center’s total energy consumption.

Meanwhile, billions of personal computers, laptops, and even phones sit idle, wasting potential computing power. While hyperscale data centers feel dominant, they actually account for less than 1% of **the world’s total potential computing power across all personal and IoT devices**. The other 99% is scattered across billions of devices—yet most of that potential remains untouched. Instead of contributing to meaningful workloads, these machines spend their cycles on light tasks like browsing, video streaming, or sitting idle. GCC aims to unlock this vast, wasted capacity, transforming everyday devices into part of a global, eco-friendly computing network.

***💡 Did you know?
A single Phone chip delivers around 2-5 TFLOPS of compute power. Multiply that by the 7.7 billion smartphones in use today, and you get an astonishing 15,400–38,500 exaflops. For comparison, the entire TOP500 supercomputers combined deliver only 13.84 exaflops.***

## Vision

GreenCompute Coin (GCC) solves this problem: Instead of relying on massive, concentrated data centers, billions of small, distributed machines (PCs, laptops, IoT devices) work together to form a **planet-scale, green supercomputer network.**

Each device contributes a little bandwidth, compute, and storage.

**Carbon Reduction Estimate:**
* A hyperscale data center consumes ~100 MW of power.
* Running 1 million GCC devices at just 10 W each = 10 MW total.
* That’s ~90% lower power usage, cutting ~400,000 tons of CO₂ emissions annually (equivalent to taking ~85,000 cars off the road).

## How it Works

* **Mining by contribution:** Users mine GCC not by wasteful hashing, but by contributing real compute/storage/bandwidth to the network. Contributors earn GCC only when they complete verified tasks. Earnings are proportional to the amount of verified work they perform.
* **Unified planetary supercomputer:** Users do not select individual nodes. All devices combine into a single global network. When a workload is submitted, the protocol automatically shards it and distributes tasks to appropriate nodes.
* **Use cases:** AI training/inference, 3D rendering, file hosting, or website serving through a decentralized, encrypted IPFS-style network.
* **Pay with GCC → Get resources:** Buy GCC coins to access secure and reliable computing power. The network automatically executes workloads across many contributors, then returns the result.
* **Eco advantage:** Small, distributed machines generate less heat and require no industrial cooling system. Compute is closer to consumers, reducing data transfer pollution.
* **Stable compute-per-dollar:** Each GCC represents the amount of verified contribution required to mine it. As scarcity increases and price rises, compute value per GCC scales so that \$1 worth of GCC always buys roughly the same amount of computation over time.

## Reputation System & Backup Guarantee

* **Proof-of-Uptime & Reputation:** Nodes build reputation by being accurate, stable, and online consistently. Reputation determines task priority and rewards.
* **Reputation Boosting (Optional):**

  * Users may **purchase additional reputation score** using GCC.
  * These funds are **redistributed to high-reputation nodes**, rewarding those who have already proven reliability.
  * In exchange, these top-tier nodes commit to act as **backup providers**, automatically covering workloads of lower-reputation nodes if they go offline unexpectedly.
* **Effect:**

  * Buyers of reputation score gain higher reliability and trust in the network.
  * Top nodes earn more income for guaranteeing coverage.
  * The entire system becomes more fault-tolerant, ensuring uptime even when less stable machines fail.

This creates a **self-sustaining reliability market** where strong nodes are incentivized to protect weaker ones, keeping the global supercomputer stable and fair.

---

## Tokenomics

* **Total supply cap:** 1 billion GCC
* **Block time:** 10 minutes
* **Reward per block:** Dynamic, based on verified contributions

  * Formula: `Block Reward = min(TotalContribution × RewardPerUnit, MaxBlockReward)`

    * `TotalContribution`: verified compute/storage/bandwidth in the block
    * `RewardPerUnit`: GCC per unit of work
    * Unit = `CPU GFLOPs×1 + GPU GFLOPs×5 + Storage GB-day×0.1 + Bandwidth GB×0.2`
    * Reward (GCC) = `Units×0.01 GCC/unit`
    * `MaxBlockReward`: 500 GCC/block max to prevent extreme spikes

### Fee & Burn Policy

To balance scarcity, usability, and ongoing development, GCC introduces a **triple-split fee system**:

* **94.5% → Contributors** 
* **5% → Burn** 
* **0.5% → Developer Treasury** 

Additionally, GCC applies **transaction-type burns**:

* **5% burn** → Compute/storage/hosting payments (utility transactions).
* **10% burn** → Peer-to-peer transfers and trading (speculative transactions).
* **Reputation score purchases** → 100% distributed to high-reputation nodes (no burn).

## GCC Workload tiers

**Tier A: Verified Compute**
* Workloads: AI training, rendering, file storage, inference, transcoding, static hosting.
* Latency: Flexible (ping-based distribution).
* Participants: Billions of personal devices.

**Tier B: Real-Time Compute**
* Workloads: Game servers, HFT, healthcare/finance APIs.
* Latency: <50 ms, reliable uptime.
* Participants: Professional servers, data centers.
* Rewards: 1.5–3× higher per compute unit.
---
## Security and Redundancy

* Every task is split and verified across multiple contributors.
* Multiple nodes back up critical data to prevent loss.
* No single point of failure.
* **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** Validators secure the chain by staking GCC, ensuring energy efficiency and Sybil resistance.
* **Proof-of-Contribution (PoC):** Contributors provide compute/storage/bandwidth and prove their work cryptographically. Rewards are distributed proportionally.
* **Proof-of-Uptime & Reputation Market:** Nodes earn reputation by staying online and being accurate. Reputation can also be boosted via GCC purchases, directly rewarding strong nodes who guarantee backups for weaker ones. This ensures stability while creating a reliability economy.
* **To ensure results are trustworthy:**
  * Task Redundancy: Every workload is assigned to at least three independent nodes.
  * Results are compared — if ≥ 2/3 match, they are accepted.
  * Proven cheaters lose rewards and reputation.

## Consensus Mechanism: PoS + PoC  

GCC eliminates wasteful Proof of Work. Instead, it uses a hybrid **Proof of Stake (PoS) + Proof of Contribution (PoC)** consensus model.  

### Proof of Stake (PoS)  
- Validators are chosen based on stake to propose and validate blocks.  
- PoS ensures chain security and Sybil resistance with minimal energy usage.  

### Proof of Contribution (PoC)  
- Contributors earn rewards for verified compute, storage, and bandwidth.  
- Tasks are redundantly executed and verified by majority consensus.  
- Contribution history and reputation influence future task assignments.  

### Hybrid Flow  
1. Validators (PoS) secure the blockchain and confirm transactions.  
2. Contributors (PoC) provide computing/storage resources.  
3. Rewards are split:  
   - PoS validators earn a small percentage for security.  
   - PoC contributors earn the majority for real-world work.

## Process

GCC turns every participating machine into a piece of a **planet-wide supercomputer**, creating a fully decentralized, eco-friendly network for computing needs.

* **Universal Contributions:** Any machine, big or small, can join. All hardware contributes CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth.
* **Task sharding & distribution:** Workloads are automatically broken into shards. More powerful nodes get more shards. The scheduler ensures redundancy and geographic diversity to improve reliability and latency.
* **Execution and verification:** Nodes execute tasks in sandboxed environments. Results are verified by multiple nodes (>50% agreement = valid).
* **Storage:** Files and datasets are split, encrypted, and stored redundantly across independent nodes.
* **Reputation market:** Uptime + accuracy build natural reputation. Paid boosts funnel resources to strong nodes, ensuring backup reliability.
* **Payment & burn:** Users pay in GCC, fees are split (94.5% contributors, 5% burn, 0.5% dev). Reputation purchases flow directly to top providers.
